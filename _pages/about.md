He received the M.S. degree in physics from [Institute of Precision Optical Engineering (IPOE)](https://ipoe.tongji.edu.cn/en/), [School of Physics Science and Engineering](https://physics.tongji.edu.cn/En/Content/77) Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2019. He is currently
pursuing the Ph.D. degree with [Center of Intelligent Acoustics and Immersive Communications (CIAIC)](https://ciaic.org/index.html),  Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi‚Äôan, China.
His research interest includes deep generative models and their applications in hyperspectral image processing, particularly, in spectral unmixing and hyperspectral/multispectral image fusion.
